# Melonama-detection
### Overview

This project showcases a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture tailored for image classification tasks. Leveraging the Keras Sequential API, the model construction is simplified, allowing for seamless layer-by-layer development.

### Key Components

- *Sequential Model Building*: The sequential approach facilitates the systematic construction of the CNN architecture, ensuring ease of development.

- *Dropout Layer*: Integration of dropout layers with a 50% dropout rate aids in mitigating overfitting by randomly deactivating input units during training.

- *Flatten Layer*: The Flatten layer transforms multi-dimensional input tensors into a single dimension, ensuring compatibility with subsequent Dense layers.

- *Dense Layer with Softmax Activation*: Dense layers with softmax activation function enable the output of class probabilities for multi-class classification tasks.

### Model Compilation

The model is compiled with the following configurations:

- *Adam Optimization*: An adaptive stochastic gradient descent method that dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on moment estimates.
  
- *Categorical Crossentropy Loss*: A well-suited loss function for multi-class classification models, particularly in scenarios with multiple output labels.

### Callbacks

- *ModelCheckpoint*: Employed during training with model.fit() to save the entire model or just the weights at specified intervals. This enables seamless continuation of training from the saved state.

- *EarlyStopping*: Utilized to halt training when a monitored metric, such as validation loss or accuracy, ceases to improve. This prevents overfitting and unnecessary training iterations.
